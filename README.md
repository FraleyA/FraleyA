## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

<!--**FraleyA/FraleyA** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.-->

My name is Austin, and I'm a University of Florida alumnus with a double major in physics and astronomy.
I've been involved in research since my second year at UF, focusing on galaxy morphology and how the visibility of merger features evolves over time. 
Currently, I'm analyzing the timescale on which merger features remain visible by studying morphological parameters like the Gini coefficient and M20.
Iâ€™m passionate about astronomy, physics, and data science, and I'm eager to apply my skills to real-world problems!

ðŸŒŒ What I'm working on: 
- Developing a repository for analyzing merger features in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation
- Exploring how morphological parameters change during galaxy mergers
- Learning SQL to expand my knowledge on database querying, and data management

ðŸ’¬ Let's talk about...
- Astrophysics & cosmology
- Data visualization & analysis
- My research on galaxy evolution
